## How to make it work ##

To run this code on your own system, put `hello.js` and `package.json` into a directory. 
In Terminal, navigate to that directory and type `npm install` -- 
this will read `package.json` and install any of the required modules. If you look at `package.json`, in the `dependencies` section, 
you'll see that this project requires the Express module.
